# Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes and SVM Algorithms

This **Spam Classifier** project uses machine learning models, specifically **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, to classify messages as spam or non-spam (ham). The model is trained on a labeled dataset consisting of messages and their corresponding labels (spam or ham). The focus is on applying traditional machine learning techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to build a spam classifier that leverages machine learning algorithms, namely **Naive Bayes** and **SVM** (Support Vector Machine), to predict whether a given message is spam or not. It uses traditional data preprocessing techniques to convert the message features into numerical data before training the models.

The focus of this project is to use the power of machine learning to automate the spam detection process, making email or messaging platforms more efficient in filtering out unwanted content.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier that applies Bayes' Theorem to predict the class of a message.
  - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: A supervised machine learning algorithm that works well for classification tasks, especially with high-dimensional data.
